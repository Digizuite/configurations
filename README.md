# Configurations #
This repository consists of sets of base configurations, that should be useable as is, though some might require minor tweaks (such as ids).

The repository contains the Automation workflow configurations that are needed with v5.5.0 as that version has removed the old Digimonitor workflow engine. Be aware that a Media Manager must be installed in order for these Automations to work.

Ontop of that there is a section containing the OOBE3 and OOBE5 workflows for the new automation workflow system. These are old, but kept there for backwards compatibility. We refer to the OOBE configuration guide on confluence for a more detailed work through.
